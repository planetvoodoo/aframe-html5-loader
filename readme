Our contribution to A-Frame (https://aframe.io) for developers who need a HTML5 loader on their A-frame project.

There aren't many guides on how to create a reliable progress based loader, so we thought it'd be nice to share our solution with the wider community. Stripped down and in it's most basic form with no dependancies. All Vanilla JS and simple code.

Feedback & improvements welcomed.
